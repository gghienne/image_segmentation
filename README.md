# Image segmentation (Topic#3)
Python implementation for image segmentation using watershed and min-cut/max-flow algorithms. You will find the associated pdf presentation in the repository's root.

## Min-cut/max-flow based algorithm (Groupe#2)
This section was implemented by Hatim El Malik and Ilan Kleiman.
They implemented two differents algorithms: a push-relabel type and the one from Kolmogorov article.
They provided a Notebook to show how to use their code as well as compare the performances of both algorithms.

##  Watershed based algorithm (Groupe#1)
This section was implemented by Guillaume Ghienne and Alexandre Lefebvre.
They implemented a trickle-version of Watershed algorithm.
A notebook is also available, it shows how to use the Watershed class, the available options as well as some results.

## Datas
For each section you will find the images that were used to test the algorithms.
